## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn add
yarn dev
```

### for wallet connect:
you should make a .env.local and put following text on that (you can use other web3 providers)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/-- your api key --
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
